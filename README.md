# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React, featuring a basic AI opponent. The game allows a player to compete against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

Player vs AI: Play against an AI opponent.
AI Move with Delay: The AI move is delayed to improve gameplay experience.
Draw Detection: The game detects and displays a draw when no moves are left and thereâ€™s no winner.
New Game: Option to start a new game once the current game ends.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Running the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building for Production

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Testing

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Code Management

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Game Instructions

1. Start the Game: Click "New Game" to start a fresh game.
2. Play: Click on any square to place your "X". The AI will automatically make a move after your turn.
3. View Status: The game status will display the winner, or if the game is a draw. You can then start a new game if desired.
